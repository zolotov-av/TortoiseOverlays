My custom icons for TortoiseGit
===============================

Fill free to use, modify, send pull-request, etc...

Currently edited only one icons (Modified) to have blue color instead of red
which I interpret as some error...

Place XPStyle2 folder in Program Files\Common Files\TortoiseOverlays\icons
and edit Tortoise Settigs, probably you need reboot to take effect
